# Reflection

## regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during 
## the course of the subject?
Regarding my accuracy, I always sided with caution when giving estimates and found myself always estimating longer then 
it would usually take.
Accuracy was up and down because we got into some new things that i was learning for the first time in the end there.

## regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?
In regard to code reviews, I find it interesting looking at other peoples code and see how they do things differently to me.

## regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
I really don't have an issue with anything. Maybe a time estimate at the start of each week practical for external 
students so the can make time?
